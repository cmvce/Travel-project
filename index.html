            <h2>Why Rome?</h2>
            <h3>Rome, the eternal city</h3>
            <p>Rome is often referred to as the City of Seven Hills due to its geographic location, and also as the "Eternal City"<br>
                According to the Ancient Romans' founding myth,[20] the name Roma came from the city's founder and first king, Romulus.[1]

                However, it is possible that the name Romulus was actually derived from Rome itself.[21] As early as the 4th century, there have been alternative theories proposed on the origin of the name Roma. Several hypotheses have been advanced focusing on its linguistic roots which however remain uncertain:[22]
                
                From Rumon or Rumen, archaic name of the Tiber, which in turn is supposedly related to the Greek verb ·ø•Œ≠œâ (rh√©≈ç) 'to flow, stream' and the Latin verb ru≈ç 'to hurry, rush';[b]
                From the Etruscan word êåìêåñêååêåÄ (ruma), whose root is *rum- "teat", with possible reference either to the totem wolf that adopted and suckled the cognately named twins Romulus and Remus, or to the shape of the Palatine and Aventine Hills;
                From the Greek word ·ø•œéŒºŒ∑ (rh·πìmƒì), which means strength

                    <p>Sofia‚Äôs is a little restaurant tucked away in the Trevi neighborhood in the heart of Rome, only minutes away from the Spanish Steps. 
                        It offers you seasonal food that pays tribute to the flavours and scents of Mediterranean cuisine.

                       In Rome we walk a lot and by walking we obviously discovered this lovely place.
                       It has typical Roman plates as well as gourmet dishes.

                    <p>One Restaurant is not your typical Chinese Restaurant. <br>
                        It offers authentic chinese food made by young students. <br>
                        It's a bit hard to find parking but it's near a metro station
                    <h5>Address:</h5>

                    <p>
                       It's different from other chinese restaurant, it's more gourmet like.
                       I suggest the "Marito e Moglie" dish.
